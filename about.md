Some information about you!

### More Information

I am a lexicographer at the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae in Munich, Germany, funded by the Austrian Ministery of Science and Research, where I write entries for the dictionary. Other research I am engaged in (as far as it is not connected with funded projects) has no outside funds, and I am dependent on the software/hardware at my own disposal. Generally, I try to be as independent of factors out of my control as far as possible. For string manipulations that are usually the prerequisite of my quantitative research I mostly use AutoIt (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/), and ever since I discovered that Windows 10 comes with support for Linux I have become an ardent (if inexperienced) user of local installations of Tesserae (http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/), the Classical Languages Toolkit (http://cltk.org/), and other Linux-only software.
